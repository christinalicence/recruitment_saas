# recruitment_saas

Django tenants - keeps data seperate, tidy. Must use PostgreSQL, set up using Neon. Built using subdomains on tenants because it keeps cookies and data completely seperate, rather than folders which is an option. 

User is created on signup with 14 day trial
        (need to improve password for new users)

Each tenant has a dashboard and no access to django admin to keep things secure and prevent them causing issues.

Crispy forms, using Bootstrap 5, used for ease.
